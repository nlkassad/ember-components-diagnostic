# Ember Components Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  Give an example of a visual hierarchy that could be modeled with components. Explain why each piece might be it's own component.

    ```md
    A blog. It would have the primary page and different sections.
    The sections could be broken into components to control view and easilly
    add new sections. Each section could have multiple articles and those
    could be components as well. This would make it so they could have
    individual actions to control view/go into articles.
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a new component called '`my-map`'?

    ```sh
    ember generate component my-map
    ```

1.  What files are created and/or edited to produce a component, and what are their responsibilities?

    ```md
    Ember component, component test
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a component '`my-contact`', which is loaded from
    '`app/contacts/template.hbs`' when visiting the `/contacts` route. What is
    the syntax (code that is written) to render this component inside that template?

    ```html
    {{my-contact}}
    ```

1.  Each contact has multiple phone numbers. Suppose you also have '`my-phone`'
    nested under '`my-contact`'. What is the code you would write in
    '`app/components/my-contact/template.hbs`' to load the nested component and
    pass it data?

    ```html
    {{my-contact/my-phone data=data}}
    ```
